                Music has always been more than just background noise; it's the invisible thread weaving through the
                tapestry of my life. Each significant moment, from the quiet reflections of adolescence to the vibrant
                adventures of adulthood, is tied to a specific melody or lyric. This page is a personal journey, an
                attempt to visualize how the songs I’ve listened to have shaped my perspective and marked the emotional
                chapters of my story, especially now that I'm aware of my autism. Through data and art, I aim to show that 
                the playlist of my life isn't just a collection of songs, but a living, breathing record of who I am.

                First, more than 1,000 songs that shaped my days
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This playlist is a collection of songs that have woven themselves into the fabric of my life, each one a unique trigger 
                for memories and moments from my journey on this planet. The main property of this list is that it includes one song
                from one artist or band, from one album. In other words, artists or bands can't be repeated here. Only one collaboration per
                artist is allowed. For example, <b>David Bowie</b> and <b>Queen</b> made a masterpiece out of <b>"Under Pressure"</b>, but I'm 
                allowed to include one more song by <b>Queen ("Bohemian Rhapsody")</b>, and one by <b>David Bowie ("Starman")</b>.<br>
                Here's the link to the playlist. It's Spotify (I know), but it might work even if you don't have an account <br>

                The power of music... the power to time travel
            </h2>
                Take <b>"Por Siempre" by DLD</b>, for instance; it instantly transports 
                me back to one of the most memorable field trips I've ever shared with my close friend, Laura Olguin. Then there are the 
                nostalgic beats of <b>"It's My Life" by Dr. Alban</b> and <b>"Be My Lover" by La Bouche</b>, which conjure images of cool, breezy nights 
                on the beach during my secondary school days, surrounded by friends and good times. 
                My musical tastes span generations, reaching far back before my time. While I'm a huge fan of The Beatles, my appreciation 
                extends to classics like <b>Édith Piaf's "La Vie en Rose" (1947)</b> and <b>Carlos Gardel's "Por una Cabeza" (1938)</b>. Music has also 
                deepened my appreciation for the sheer beauty and complexity of language. While some lyrics may not carry profound personal 
                meaning for me, the interplay of voice and instruments often creates an undeniable harmony. For example, many Black Metal 
                songs delve into themes of evil, and while I'm not religious, I find their lyrics profound and eloquent, even if their 
                specific meaning doesn't always resonate with my own thoughts. <br>
                Interestingly, this playlist reveals a strong influence from artists and bands from the USA and UK, often overshadowing those 
                from Mexico or even songs sung in Spanish.
                Given the depth and breadth of this collection, it's impossible for me to pick a single favorite song of all time. I invite 
                you to explore it, especially those tracks you might not recognize. Perhaps some will spark a special memory for you, or 
                connect you to a moment in my life. Or perhaps, they'll simply be a pleasure to listen to. You certainly won't have 75 hours 
                to listen to them all at once, but I hope you find some free time to delve into a few. In the meantime, I'll be using plots 
                to share some specific insights into my preferences within this musical journey. Yes, I know it's a bit nerdy, but that's just 
                me – and you probably already knew that!

                Hordes of melodies ripple... splashing deep into memory
             </h2>
               <p class="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
               Let us begin with a handful of songs tied to the so-called "Hipster" movement. <b>Mumford & Sons</b>' <b>"I Will Wait"</b> instantly reminds me of a brief but meaningful love adventure I had in the Mayan 
               territories during my Ph.D. I hoped, much like the song suggests, that a miracle would happen. That miracle never materialized, yet it remains a beautiful memory that haunts me on rainy days.
               Several one-hit wonders also made the list. <b>"What's Up"</b> by <b>4 Non Blondes </b> transports me back to my dull middle school years. A more recent example is <b>"Somebody That I Used to Know"</b> 
               by <b>Gotye and Kimbra</b>, a track that echoes my journey through the dark days of my final Master's years—a time when I finally escaped my self-made prison guarded by a misunderstood character in my path.
               As the playlist continues, you'll find different rhythms and languages (English dominates, though), exploring themes of love, magic, evil, or perhaps nothing profound at all. <br>Regardless of the 
               lyrics, every song touches a sensitive fiber, sparking a memory that reminds me of who I am. Take <b>"The Sum of All Fears"</b> by <b>Cultus Sanguine</b>. I first heard this song in my favorite music "cave"—the 
               record store run by the sensei Psychonauta, Luis, the vocalist of the metal band Pactum. Luis, a guru who encouraged me to explore the dark and mysterious, loved sharing music. When he played the 
               chords of Cultus Sanguine, it took me somewhere deep (a journey certainly amplified by an ongoing depression at the time). That song, among a few others, returns me to a time when I simply enjoyed 
               listening to music, nothing more. I don't recall liking more songs by the band, but that moment was everything. <br>
               </p>

                   A Single Shade of Self: Exploring My Persona Through This Core Music List
               </h2>
               <p class="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                As mentioned before, it is impossible to fully write, or even reflect, a lifetime through music. As years pass, new songs resonate with our changing ideologies, experiences, and feelings. 
                Consequently, while some music might sound similar, the track chosen here may not always be the most popular or have the best beat or chorus. Regardless, these songs were significant because 
                they appeared at the right time. Though they don't all represent completely different situations, they offer different angles to the same picture. I have spent many hours carefully curating this
                list, ensuring each one is the right fit. Reaching a list of 1,000 songs by 1,000 different artists was surprisingly straightforward. The true difficulty was selecting just one song from my favorite 
                artists, as many of their tracks hold memories tied to various issues. Because of this, I've created an additional project: 1,000 songs by my favorite artists. The only rule here is a maximum of 
                ten songs per artist—a necessary constraint on memories, but one that ultimately serves to showcase the breadth of my musical taste beyond simply telling my story.
                Here's that <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Y1vxJznJdWhBibgoxD7DE?si=cb9eaae5f3d74d01" target="_blank" style="color: green;"> second list </a>. But first, I want to comment on a few 
                songs from artists who, perhaps, didn't quite make the cut for the original list.
