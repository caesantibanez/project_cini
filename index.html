                Music has always been more than just background noise; it's the invisible thread weaving through the
                tapestry of my life. Each significant moment, from the quiet reflections of adolescence to the vibrant
                adventures of adulthood, is tied to a specific melody or lyric. This page is a personal journey, an
                attempt to visualize how the songs I’ve listened to have shaped my perspective and marked the emotional
                chapters of my story, especially now that I'm aware of my autism. Through data and art, I aim to show that 
                the playlist of my life isn't just a collection of songs, but a living, breathing record of who I am.

                First, more than 1,000 songs that shaped my days
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This playlist is a collection of songs that have woven themselves into the fabric of my life, each one a unique trigger 
                for memories and moments from my journey on this planet. Take <b>"Por Siempre" by DLD</b>, for instance; it instantly transports 
                me back to one of the most memorable field trips I've ever shared with my close friend, Laura Olguin. Then there are the 
                nostalgic beats of <b>"It's My Life" by Dr. Alban</b> and <b>"Be My Lover" by La Bouche</b>, which conjure images of cool, breezy nights 
                on the beach during my secondary school days, surrounded by friends and good times. 
                My musical tastes span generations, reaching far back before my time. While I'm a huge fan of The Beatles, my appreciation 
                extends to classics like <b>Édith Piaf's "La Vie en Rose" (1947)</b> and <b>Carlos Gardel's "Por una Cabeza" (1938)</b>. Music has also 
                deepened my appreciation for the sheer beauty and complexity of language. While some lyrics may not carry profound personal 
                meaning for me, the interplay of voice and instruments often creates an undeniable harmony. For example, many Black Metal 
                songs delve into themes of evil, and while I'm not religious, I find their lyrics profound and eloquent, even if their 
                specific meaning doesn't always resonate with my own thoughts. 
                Interestingly, this playlist reveals a strong influence from artists and bands from the USA and UK, often overshadowing those 
                from Mexico or even songs sung in Spanish.
                Given the depth and breadth of this collection, it's impossible for me to pick a single favorite song of all time. I invite 
                you to explore it, especially those tracks you might not recognize. Perhaps some will spark a special memory for you, or 
                connect you to a moment in my life. Or perhaps, they'll simply be a pleasure to listen to. You certainly won't have 75 hours 
                to listen to them all at once, but I hope you find some free time to delve into a few. In the meantime, I'll be using plots 
                to share some specific insights into my preferences within this musical journey. Yes, I know it's a bit nerdy, but that's just 
                me – and you probably already knew that!
